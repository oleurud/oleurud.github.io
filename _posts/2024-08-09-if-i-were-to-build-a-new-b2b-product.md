summary:    In the last few months, I've been thinking about what we could have done differently at Stomio to grow faster. Here are some of the ideas if I were starting a new project

First of all, there are people with more experience and success than me, like: [levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio), [Marc Lou](https://x.com/marc_louvion), or [Greg Isenberg](https://x.com/gregisenberg). These are just my learnings from founding companies.

Second, company size matters. It's different if you want to create a solo company, a company of 20-50 people, or a fast-growing startup. Each of these cases is unique. I'll focus more on the second: a small to medium-sized company backed by VCs.

Third, team will be remote because I live in a small village.

Fourth, it will be a tech company.

So, 

## Ordered steps:

1. Choose the right partner. Ensure you have the same objectives, cultural fit, and a shared vision of success.
2. Some people will tell you to create a community around your company topic before doing anything else. When you launch a new product, you’ll be seen as a reference in the field, and people will be willing to use it and provide feedback. I completely agree if your company is B2C. If it’s B2B, it can be harder depending on the company’s field.
3. Create a detailed landing with a waitlist and drive traffic to it. If no one cares, pivot.
4. Solo founders: create an MVP that can attract free users and at least one paid customer. If it's not happening, pivot.
5. Raise money.
6. Create a team:
    1. The team must cover product, engineering, marketing, and sales. They should also handle customer success and support.
    2. Remote work is fine, but ensure at least 3-4 hours of overlap each day.
    3. Don't hire new people until you really need them.
    4. Believe in your team and always be transparent. Share the journey and don't push them too much.
7. Focus on the main feature and make it shine, the rest can be just good enough. If you're not growing, pivot.
8. If you still want a bigger rocket: add features and increase prices. Again, if you're not growing, pivot.
