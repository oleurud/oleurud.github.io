It is true right now as a spanish developer, you can get opportunities unthinkable a few years ago in well-known US companies such as Meta, Amazon, Shopify, ... that were previously only for those who were the best of the best. So, why? Why make your life harder creating a company?

I love to build things. It is as simple as that. This is the fastest explanation. Let's go to the long one:

### Make things happen

When you make something, spending time on it, leaving other things behind, exposing yourself to others, ... and that thing you built starts to help somebody, it is an incredible feeling that empowers you and your life.

In your own company, you have a lot of the first things, and hopefully, also of the second one.

### Learning in the process

I don't know all the answers and I will change my mind about specific points because I will learn in the process.

Being wrong should not be a problem, only for your ego (so please, keep it away). When I realize I am wrong, I feel I grow as a person or professional. And again, that's an amazing feeling.
### I want to build things in the way I think they should be

We spent the first week of our company's life thinking about things like values, culture, and vision. Maybe you might think that we were starting the house from the roof. You may think it would be better to spend that time thinking about how to sell your product, your go-to-market strategy, or creating a business plan. And yeah, maybe you are right. As I said, I don't know all the answers.

But I believe in people. We believe in people and their values. If people's values match with yours and cultural and personal fit happens, everything can be done. It is a factor that multiplies knowledge, hunger, and desire.

[These are our values in Stomio](https://stomio.io/about-us). They are very simple. And powerful.

I haven't done this before and I don't know what exactly needs to be done to maintain it over time. I have lived through companies losing their culture and I would not like to go to work one day and see that this has happened in mine. So, we will need to learn in the process again :)
