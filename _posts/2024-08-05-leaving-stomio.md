This past Friday was my last official day as an employee at Stomio, and today, I am starting a new journey with a different company.

In 2021, I co-founded Stomio with Ibra and Ayham after two years of creating the first version during our after-work hours. We wanted to create something impactful with a great company culture, and I am proud to say that we made it. 

Over this time, we were fortunate to work with talented professionals in a fully remote environment. I am particularly proud of our team in Spain, where we developed a great product solving a complex and significant problem.

Stomio is not yet where we wanted it to be, but there is a lot of success on the horizon. 

Thank you to all who have been part of this journey: teammates, investors, and clients.
