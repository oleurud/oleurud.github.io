Hi, Iâ€™m Simon Martin, a software developer based in Santander, Spain.

I have played many roles in my career, mainly as a backend engineer, but also as a full stack developer, tech lead and engineering manager. My tech journey has been diverse, spanning sectors like travel, advertising, GIS, telecom, insurance, and product management.

My main skills:

- Product-oriented: I donâ€™t understand technology any other way.
- Business-oriented: Iâ€™ve started a company twice and worked in several startups, helping them (sometimes ðŸ™‚) move from 0 to 1. Product-led, SaaS, B2B, B2C.
- Versatile developer: I can create products from scratch or work with large legacy codebases. I can design simple APIs or work with complex architectures.
- Versatile tech stack: Iâ€™m skilled in Node.js and Vue.js, but I quickly pick up new technologies. I have worked with Python, Java, PHP, C, and others. My database experience includes PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB. Iâ€™ve used AWS and Google Cloud.
- Team player and leader: Whether as an individual contributor or leading a team, I enjoy mentoring junior developers, improving processes, and helping teams reach their full potential to deliver the best product possible.

Iâ€™m a father of two amazing kids, a car enthusiast, and I love craft beer, music, and tech. I believe in being straightforward and honest, and Iâ€™m always up for a good conversation over a great beer.
