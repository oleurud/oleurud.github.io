I am Simon Martin, a software developer living in Madrid. I love music, beer and tech.

As a developer, I do mostly backend, but also frontend and even devops. I am proud of creating products that help people, some of them with millions of requests per day. I can code in several languages and platforms: Node.js, Vue.js and Python are the ones I have used the most in the last years. I did JAVA, PHP, or C in the past. I have worked for several startups, big companies and I have founded mine twice.

And as a person, I hope to be a good father and friend. But you'll have to ask them. I'm usually honest and a bit blabbermouth, but I am improving it. When I am not creating a new product, I am enjoying music or drinking a beer.
