I'm Simon Martin, a remote senior software developer living in Santander (Spain). I love music, craft beer and technology.

As a developer, I do mainly backend, but also frontend and even devops. I'm proud of creating products that help people, some of them with millions of requests per day. I can code in several languages and platforms: Node.js, Vue.js and Python are the ones I've used the most in the last years. In the past I did JAVA, PHP or C. I have experience using databases like PostgreSQL, Redis or MongoDB. I have worked for several startups, big companies and founded my own twice.

As a person, I hope to be a good father and friend, but you will have to ask them :). I tend to be honest, direct when necessary and a bit mouthy, but I'm getting better at it. When I'm not creating a new product, I'm enjoying music or tasting a good beer.
