I'm Simon Martin, a remote senior software developer living in Santander (Spain). I love music, craft beer, business and technology.

I have never wanted to be an expert in anything, but to have a broad and generalist knowledge of business and engineering. Therefore, I have worked for different types of companies, from startups to large companies, in different sectors (such as travel, advertising, GIS or car insurance), on-site and remote and in different roles. And I have founded my own company twice.

My role in companies is mainly related to technical side doing backend, frontend or even devops, but what I really like is to make teams better working with other people. If you are curious about specific technologies, I can code in several languages and platforms: Node.js, Vue.js and Python are the ones I have used the most in the last years. In the past I have done JAVA, PHP or C. I have experience using databases like PostgreSQL, Redis or MongoDB.

As a person, I try my best to be a good father and friend, but you'll have to ask them :). I tend to be honest, direct when necessary and a bit mouthy, but I'm getting better at it. When I'm not creating a new product, I am enjoying music or tasting a good beer.
