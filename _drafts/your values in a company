If I tell you that we spent the first week of our company's life thinking about things like values, culture and vision, you might think that we were starting the house from the roof. You may think it would be better to spend that time thinking about how to sell your product, your go-to-market strategy or creating a business plan. And yeah, maybe you are right. 

First of all, we started our company as side project, basically doing 3 things: talking with people, implementing an MVP based on the insights from these talks, and talking with more people to validate it. 

After that, we look for more people to help us to transform our side project in a company: helping us to create the structure, bringing us experience, advice, ... and money. And finally, we spend a lot of time looking for more people to join us to make it a real company.

As you see, I am repeating `people` all the time. Because everything is about that. Of course, the go-to-market strategy is important, but even more important is the group of human beings who work together with the same goal over a period of time and who make up the company. Perhaps, we will find the answers and success. Maybe we won't. But a group of people together have a better chance of achieving it. I strongly and selfishly believe that putting people first is the best business decision.

This why our first days as company were about thinking about the values and culture. People go first. Always.
