If I tell you that we spent the first week of our company's life thinking about things like values, culture and vision, you might think that we were starting the house from the roof. You may think it would be better to spend that time thinking about how to sell your product, your go-to-market strategy or creating a business plan. 

And yeah, maybe you are righ, but I don't think it is the way. At least not our way. 

First of all, we, the three founders, started our company as side project, basically doing 2 things: talking with people and implementing an MVP based on the insights from these talks. Our objective was to validate the idea and look for the approach to make it real. 

After that, we look for more people to help us to transform our side project in a company: helping us to create the structure, bringing us experience and advice, ... and money. Because finally, we were looking for more people to join to company
